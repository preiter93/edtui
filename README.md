### `EdTUI`

#### Overview
`EdTUI` is a text editor widget for the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) ecosystem.
It is designed to provide a light-weight user experience inspired by Vim.

```rust
use edtui::{EditorState, EditorTheme, EditorView};
use ratatui::widgets::Widget;

let mut state = EditorState::default();
EditorView::new(&mut state)
        .theme(EditorTheme::default())
        .wrap(true) // line wrapping
        .render(area, buf)
```

### Features
- Vim-like keybindings and editing modes for efficient text manipulation.
- Normal, Insert and Visual mode.
- Clipboard: Uses the `arboard` clibpboard by default which allows copy pasting between the
  system clipboard and the editor.
- Line wrapping

### Experimental Mouse Support

`Edtui` now includes experimental mouse support. To enable it activate the feature
```toml
[dependencies.edtui]
version = "0.7"
features = ["mouse-support"]
```
and use the mouse event handler
```rust
let event_handler = EditorEvent::default();
event_handler.on_mouse_event(mouse_event, &mut state);
```

**Note**: This feature is experimental, so expect potential bugs and breaking changes. It does currently not work correctly on wrapped lines.

#### Roadmap

- [x] Clipboard
- [x] Search
- [x] Soft-wrap lines

- [ ] Vims `f`/`t` go to first
- [ ] Support termwiz and termion
- [ ] Display line numbers
- [ ] Remap keybindings
